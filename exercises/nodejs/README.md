Test with node.js
=================

To install dependencies
`npm install`

To run tests
`npm test`

If you would like the tests to run in watch mode, run `npm run test:watch`.

By default this runs the tests for any files that have changed, however you can choose to only run a particular file by pressing `p` and then entering a pattern to match a file. For example, to only run the tests for the checkout task, you could press `p` then enter `checkout`.

To cancel watch mode, press `q` to quit.
