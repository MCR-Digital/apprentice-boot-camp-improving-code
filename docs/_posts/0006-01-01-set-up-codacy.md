## Exercise: Set up Codacy against your fork of the repository

* Work individually
* Visit [www.codacy.com](https://www.codacy.com) and click ‘Get started’
* Authorize Codacy to access your public GitHub repos
* Activate Codacy for your fork
* Wait for it to analyse your code
* Filter to your language and read through the results
* ⚠️ Don’t change the code at this stage to fix issues! ⚠️

Notes: Changing the code will impact the code review exercise.  
    Super easy, but hosted systems are more complex.  
    Was it useful?  
    Did you find anything that you’d missed in the code smell exercise, or reviewing manually?
