## Code Smells

(but not all code)

--

## Purpose:

### Provide language to discuss problems

+ Less ambiguous if language is shared
+ Takes ego away from conversation
+ Helps you identify issues
+ Suggests resolutions

--

> A code smell is a hint that something has gone wrong somewhere in your code. Use the smell to track down the problem.  
>   
> Note that a CodeSmell is a hint that something might be wrong, not a certainty.

Originated from Kent Beck’s [Once And Only Once](http://wiki.c2.com/?OnceAndOnlyOnce) rule.  
(see also [CodeSmell](http://wiki.c2.com/?CodeSmell)).

> The program should express each idea once and only once - there should be no duplicate code.

Note: Kent also created extreme programming, helped form the Agile Manifesto, is the leading proponent of TDD, spawned unit testing frameworks and popularised CRC cards.  
  OAOO similar to DRY but subtly different

+ Things can smell ‘off’ without knowing why: ‘the sniff test’
+ Your sense of smell will improve
    + Important to develop your own intuition
+ Code smells descriptions help in the meantime
    + They are not commandments!

Notes: Everyone has a sense of smell  
  Will become more refined  
  Can’t always tell what something is  
  Can usually tell if it smells good or bad

## No single definitive list of smells

You’ll find smells referenced in one list which aren’t described in another 

Notes: Conventions have appeared over the years.  
  You may recognise some of them.

## Upcoming exercise…

+ Explore *some* smells
+ Practice addressing them
