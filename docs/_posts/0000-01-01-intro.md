## Zoom etiquette

+ Recording—consent?
+ Have your camera on please
+ If you have a question please speak up
  + If you aren’t confident to interrupt, feel free to put your hand up 
  + Mute in the group sessions, and push space bar to talk 
+ Use Slack chat rather than Zoom chat box
  + Can find stuff later, easier for us to spot

## Feedback from last boot camp

Overall score: 8/10

--

## You liked

+ Having time to study at your own pace
+ Targeted reading suggestions
+ Ben’s security demo

--

## You didn’t like

+ The security demo required prior experience to follow
+ Resources being delivered in PDF?
+ Slides were rushed—would have preferred group conversation instead
+ Not being provided a Udemy course or similar
+ That we went ahead with the boot camp in a self-directed format—would have preferred that we delayed
