# Article 7, Section 3 allows for a citizen filibuster.

If I stand here and refuse to yield my time, you are prohibited from voting on the bill.

Let the filibustering begin!

As many of you have noted, that use the internet, it has been announced that Disney has acquired the rights to the Star Wars franchise and in the summer of 2015 we will see the release of Star Wars Episode 7.

Herewith is my proposal for the plot of that movie.

Begin with standard title sequence and John Williams fanfare followed by a scroll to be written.

I would like to mention that Brian de Palma wrote the original opening scroll for Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope.

I think it would be a nice nod, uh, to the franchise if were to write this opening scroll.

Then pan down from the twin suns of Tattoine, uh, we are now close on the mouth of the Sarlacc pit.

After a beat, the gloved, Mandalorian armor gauntlet of Boba Fett grabs onto the sand outside the Sarlacc pit and the feared bounty hunter pulls himself from the maw of the sand beast.
